1)Provide a brief introduction to the assignment along with a link to this page for further details

In Assignment 2, we were asked to improve the e-commerce website that we created in our Assignment 2. More specefically, our website should be designed so that once the customers select the goods that they would like to purchase from our store, they would have to either login or register to see their invoice. If the customers already have an account they would have to provide us with their username and password to verify that they are in our system. However, if they are not in our system they have the opportunity to register with us by providing us their fullname, the username they would like to be addressed with, their password, retyping their password for verification and an email to tie everything together. Furthermore, once the customers go through the corrects channels to register or login, they would be greeted while receiving their invoice.
