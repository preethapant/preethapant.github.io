I'm not going to lie, this class has been a mixture of great excitment and new opportunities and at times a mind boggling challenge. Nevertheless, I have attained a whirlwind of knowledge and deep understanding for the subject matter in the last four months than I have ever had before. Prior to taking this course I was aware of the different programming languages, such as JavaScript, C++, Python and more that are used to develop pages along with a varitety of other functions but I didn't know how to manipulate it and use these different functions to create something worthwhile and usable. To be honest, it probably would be hard to master all the different types of programmming languages but at least understanding JavaScript and its many functionalities is a start and I hope gaining these valuable skills will be an asset for the future. 

My programming skills have greatly improved. I completly agree with this statement. In the beginning I could only list the different programming languages but in reality didnt undestand what they were and how the function to create the innovative and necessary tasks required to make an effective/ functioning resource. However four months in, I am able to create a webpage by manipulate different functions, creating strings through concatenation, effectively using loops to display items in an array among others as was needed in Assignment 1.

I am enthusiastic about programming. This statement also holds to be true. I consider myself to be a curious person always seeking different ways
