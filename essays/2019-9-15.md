Doing my first WOD was one of a kind experience. Sure, I have worked with HTML and CSS before, but never using a code runner, such as VS Code, nor was I aware of the intricacies that went into writing and developing codes. Furthermore, after my first jab at using VS Code I realized that to have a good footing on coding, one must be proactive and play with the different functions within the applications. Taking this into account, I started the WOD’s with the intention that I would do each one multiple times. Although, I timed my first attempts for BrowserHistory1, BrowserHistory2 and BrowserHistory3, I wasn’t really concerned about my efficiency, instead my goal was to understand the concept in terms of visual code. Due to this, my first attempts for the three different browser history assignment exceeded by long shot the recommended time. In fact it took me 32 minutes to complete BrowserHistory1 the first time around. It was only on my third time of trying and manipulating the different layout and portions within the html document that I was able to reduce my time to 14 minutes, a little over half my original speed. 

Similarly, I took my time doing BrowserHistory2, the first time around it took me about 25 minutes and after the second time I was able to cut it down to 12 minutes. However, the one thing that I struggled with the BrowserHistory2 was linking the html file to CSS. For the longest time I had the hardest time using the correct format in the head portion of the html file where html is supposed to link. It was only refreshing my memory, after watching the screencast that I realized that I had to define the type of file that I was linking. Similarly, prior to watching the video, I had defined the font for the headings only in the CSS but realized that I had to make a link to the original source also in the html file. Lastly, the one thing that stood out to me from BrowserHistory2 is that defining attributes in html is different from defining attributes in CSS. For example in html we have to use <> to define attribute in html whereas we have to use {} in CSS. It is only after couple tries that I had this concept clear.

Personally, I found BrowserHistory3 to be a little easier than BrowserHistory1 and BrowserHistory2. This might simply be because there was less to do in the last one and was more geared towards the general look of the webpage. Thus, I was able to complete BrowserHistory3 in 12 minutes the first time and 7 minutes when I did it the second time around. Nevertheless, BrowserHistory3 taught me more about wrapping of texts and creating columns along with manipulating the looks of the navigation bar. If there is one thing that I learned from my first WOD is that although it is important to do these tasks in a timely fashion, we have to first understand the steps and the methods by which we are manipulating the code to get there.
